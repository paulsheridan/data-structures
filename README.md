# data-structures
A repository that will hold sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Python.  It includes: A Singly Linked List, A Doubly Linked List and a Stack

A Linked List is useful when:
    You don't need random access to the elements.
    You need to push and retrieve values to/from the beginning of the list in constant time.
    You need to push and retrieve values to/from the beginning or the end in constant time (doubly linked list only).
    You want to push items to the middle of the list easily and quickly.

A Stack might be useful when:
    You'd like to completely walk through a file system data tree using its first-in-last-out structure.
    You want a list structured only to pop things out in the reverse order you put them in.
