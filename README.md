# data-structures
A repository that will hold sample code for a number of classic data structures implemented in Python.  It includes: A Singly Linked List, A Doubly Linked List and a Stack

A Linked List is useful when:
    You don't need random access to the elements.
    You need to push and retrieve values to/from the beginning of the list in constant time.
    You need to push and retrieve values to/from the beginning or the end in constant time (doubly linked list only).
    You want to push items to the middle of the list easily and quickly.

A Stack might be useful when:
    You'd like to completely walk through a file system data tree using its first-in-last-out structure.
    You want a list structured only to pop things out in the reverse order you put them in.

The Heap self-organizes whenever a change is made and will always pop the largest available value inside it.

The Priority Queue takes tuples of value/priority (from 0 to 4) and organizes the inputs by priority.  The highest priority tuples will always pop from the list.
